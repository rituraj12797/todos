Ritu Raj's assignment for 99 Yellow
# Setting up development environment
  1. Prerequisites
      - you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your machine
  2. installing dependencys 
      - this project is shared without node_modules folder so you have to install all the the dependencys by your self.
      - to install dependencys:
        1. open your command line
        2. go to both these directroies ```/frontend/task-manager-app/``` and ```/backend``` check that node modules are pre installed ( if not you can install them from `npm i` command in you command shell) if they are pre installed just move to step 3.
        3. after installing all the dependencys you are ready to start the application:
         - to start the application run ```npm start``` in both directories.
        4. for MongoDB I have connected the Database with my MongoDB Atlas cloud for hassle free setup.
